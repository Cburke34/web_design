        <h3>

            The sun fades away behind you as the mouth of the cave engulfs it. After carefully walking for what felt like an hour, your eyes have adjusted enough to make out shapes around you. However, you've been using your phone as a light source, and the battery is critically low.

            In the distance, a faint silhouette begins to turn towards you. It readies itself and assumes a running stance.

        </h3>
