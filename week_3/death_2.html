            You charge the creature head first and attempt a tackle. The attack works flawlessly, but you realize afterwards that the creature you've attacked gave no fight. It screams "NO" and you achnowledge the sound of growling around you. You try your hardest to fend this beast off, but in the end you are pushed too far beyond your limit.
