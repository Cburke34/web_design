            You quickly line up and take the shot. For a brief moment, the camera's display shows you what hides in the dark: A person covered in cuts and bruises with a face of pure agony. But what truly stuns you isn't the despairing stature of the person, but the beast that hunts them. Before you have time to decipher the image, the agonized person grabs your arm screaming: "Run!"

        </h3>
