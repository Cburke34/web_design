            Seeing an opportunity, you strike at the beast with all your strength and impale the creature's eye with the blade. The beast flinches in pain, but you stumble backward in utter fear. Then a hand grabs you on the shoulder and pulls you backward. The beast retaliates, lunging forward and cutting deep into your arm. Luckily, it backs away, glaring at you with one opened eye as your newly found friend pulls you out of the Devil's Tomb.
